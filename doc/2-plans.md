# Backup Plans

There is a possibility that some parts of the project will not be able to be completed on time.
The parts that are at risk include implementing the Kintinuous algorithm with the Point Cloud Library.
If this can not happen, I will modify the kinfu app to export the mesh it creates. Another possibility
is to use the kinfu_largescale app that PCL has implemented. If I am able to get through all of my goals
including the viewer, I am going to try to use the NVidia Jetson TK1 [[@_buy_jetson]] to create a portable backpack for
generating environments with out the need for a bulky laptop.
