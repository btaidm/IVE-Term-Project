    The end goal of this project is build a scene with a XBox Kinect
    from a real world environment. This is useful in many aspects of
    3d graphics and consumer Virtual Reality (VR). In 3D graphics, this
    can be used to build scenes for video games from sets and create realistic
    environments for users to navigate. In consumer VR, this can be used in
    real estate for creating free roaming virtual tours.

    Over the course of this project, I will be implementing algorithms found
    with the KinectFusion [[@newcombe_kinectfusion:_2011; @izadi_kinectfusion:_2011]]
    project based the PCL open source implemention [[@_documentation_pcl]], as well
    as the algothims from Kintinuous papers. I will also create a viewer that can work
    with the display wall and head mounted displays in the Immersive Visualization Studio lab.
